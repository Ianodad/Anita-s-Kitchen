Description
Created a Landing page using the markup language 

IP2

This is a creation a Main landing page Anitas Kitchen. It consists of orange theme setting mixed with a dash of white. The project was done using HTML CSS and bootstrap. There was also use of outside source like fontawsome. The page has been connected to the google analytics.

I'd like to first mention that the biggest problems I encountered during this project were really finding ways to complete the project before time. I also enccounted a difficulty learning the in and outs of bootstrap. Combine this with new elements i found it hard to manage. The other challenge that i was unable to do was the addition of a working tab pill menu. I found this real challenging trying to duplicate the one i so on the image.

Anyway, my implementation of this IP took alot of new information to learn that was not available. In other words, I tried to make my website as easy as possible while still maintaining the guidelines set.Hence the lack of javascript.
A lot of the code used was basic html mixed with bootsrap. I dint understand javascript to implement. I tried my hardest not to copy, but I have this uncanny ability to understand code that has been already been used in other projects so it was hard not to implement the same way.
